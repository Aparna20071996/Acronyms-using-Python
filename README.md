# Acronyms-using-Python

An acronym is a short form of a word created by long words or phrases such as NLP for natural language processing. In this article, I will walk you through how to write a program to create acronyms using Python.

   **Create Acronyms using Python**
   
To create acronyms using Python, you need to write a python program that generates a short form of a word from a given sentence. You can do this by splitting and indexing to get the first word and then combine it.I am first taking a string user input, then I am using the split() function in Python for splitting the sentence. Then I declared a new variable ‘acr’ to store the acronym of a phrase.

   **Summary**
   
This is a great python program to test your logical skills. These types of programs contribute a lot to your coding interviews. So you should keep trying such programs to develop a good understanding of creating algorithms to perform well in your coding interviews.
